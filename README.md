# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
<h1>About Myself</h1>
Hi, my name is Eric Tran, I have a science background in chemistry and biochemistry with a bachelor degree of Science from Monash University, with a major in Chemistry and minor in Immunology.
I have worked as lab assistant for 2 years, where my role revolves with blood samples and collect patient data for medical research. After completing my bootcamp course under Monash University, I am now an aspiring data analyst
within the data science industry. <br/>
 <br/>
 This repository showcases the various projects that displays different programming languages and see the progression of my journey as an aspiring Data Analyst.

<h3>Portfolio Study Projects</h3>
This section showcases the various projects that I've created during my bootcamp course. For each of the projects, there will be a brief summary about the project's context, what program language used, as well as the link to the repository which explains
about the project in more details.
