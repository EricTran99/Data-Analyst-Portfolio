# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About Myself
Hi, my name is Eric Tran, I have a analytical and scientific background in analytical chemistry and biochemistry, I’m currently working as a lab assistant for Monash University at Alfred Hospital. I have developed and improved my skill in the medical science and desire in using data to uncover insight that are beyond statistics. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the data industry as an entry-level data specialist. <br/>
 <br/>
During my bootcamp course, I have learned and hone my skill in working with complicated data through various programming tools in order to identify trends and patterns. In addition, in my experience in the laboratory environment, I have honed my skill in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable for my role as a data specialist. <br/>
 <br/>
During my free time, I continue to explore and improve my programming skills beyond my time during the bootcamp, as well as testing my skills with various projects, whether the topic is based on real world data or personal curiosity. I’m always driven in finding insights that can’t be seen through a table of number and the satisfaction in using data as the answer to solving complex problems. <br/>
 <br/>
My CV is attached as [Eric Tran CV](https://github.com/Nisloen/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Eric%20Tran%20CV.docx)<br/>
 <br/>
 This repository showcases the various projects that displays different programming languages and see the progression of my journey as an aspiring Data Analyst.<br/>
